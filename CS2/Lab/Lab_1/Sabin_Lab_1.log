This is my first time taking 2170
I hope to have a strong understanding of C++ by the end of the semester.
My current level of comfort would be about a 7/10.
I have both MacOS and Windows
Yes, I actually write code in SQL and Python for my current job.
N/a
I am at a 8.5/10 comfort level
I plan on dedicating at least 4 hours a week for practice
I work a full time job while attending school full time, so I work 40 hours 
I plan to ensure that I use proper time management and complete the labs in lab

Labs are due on Friday at 5pm
No, they can not
Yes, they can, but it is 10% off each date late before the deadline
You should include the section of the class (Ex: 2170-XXX)
